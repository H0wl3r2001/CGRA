## TP 1 Notes

- In exercise 1 we observed that it was dificult at first to grasp and understand what to do and how to. Once we finally understood the exercise went smoothly.
- In exercise 2 we had no difficulties whatsoever, because we had understood the code completely in the previous exercise. We did notice something interesting, however. It seems that when we draw an object, we end up only drawing one of its faces. The face to be drawn depends on the order we specify the vertices in. This can be a double edged sword. On one hand, it allows us to manage how many resources we use up. If we can expect the user to never be able to see the other side of whatever it is we are showing him, we can just completely ignore it, and, therefore, not even draw that side! Of course, should the user find a way to see the other side, they'll find that they can just see through that object as if it wasn't even there, completely shattering the user's immersion!
