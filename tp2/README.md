## TP 2 Notes

- In exercise 1 we observed that, once again, once the concept was grasped the resolution went smoothly.
- In exercise 2 we had a hard work figuring out the right transformations for the tangram to look fine, because we were mixing figures with integer side-length with ones with square-root of 2 (multiples of) as length.
- In exercise 3 we noticed that it was easy to draw the cube, because of the challenges tackled in the previous exercise.
- In exercise 4 we did not notice anything special. It was simple.
